# Number guesser Game Project

## Description

This solution provides a modular approach to the Number Guesser Game. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user is prompted to guess this number. For each incorrect guess, the user receives a hint and their score is reduced.

## How to Run

1. Navigate to the main project directory (`number_guesser`).
2. Add the current directory to the `PYTHONPATH` and run the `main.py` script:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
python src/main.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.
